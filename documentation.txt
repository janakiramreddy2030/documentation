maven install
===============================
--> pre requisists
1. java above 1.8 version



install Java-1.8.0 version
--> sudo yum list | grep java-1.8         ( to list the java versions )
--> sudo yum install java-1.8.0-devel     ( choose the required package from the listed out earlier)
--> java -version                         ( to check the java version)
    if java verison is pointing to old versions then choose the new version by playing below command
--> sudo update-alternatives --config java ( to show the alternate versions available on the name you given)
    once passing the command you will get the list of available versions which is you have installed previously and you will notice the current 
    pointing verison with its shows >>+ . and containing numbers. it asks for choosing the version by passing the number which verison you want to point out.


2. install maven
--> open Goole--> type maven download --> choose maven-download apache maven--> Binary tar.gz archive or Binary zip archive --> copy the link 
    (https://mirrors.estointernet.in/apache/maven/maven-3/3.6.3/binaries/apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz   or 
     https://mirrors.estointernet.in/apache/maven/maven-3/3.6.3/binaries/apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.zip)
--> pass the below commands in command line
--> default home directory path of maven is /opt/
--> cd /opt				 ( change directory to /opt directory)
--> sudo wget https://mirrors.estointernet.in/apache/maven/maven-3/3.6.3/binaries/apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz ( tar file is get from the crome)
    it create the tar file.
--> ls                                   ( long list - it lists the files and folders on the current directory)
--> once wget the tar you will find the file apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz
--> sudo tar -xvf apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz ( to untare the file)
--> ls
    apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz   apache-maven-3.6.3
--> sudo rm apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz ( rm command used to remove the file-- here we have to remove the tar file for saving the memory)
--> sudo mv apache-maven-3.6.3/ maven3    ( mv command used to move or rename the file--here we are renameing the file name for our easy usage- any name which is relevent to you)
--> ls
    aws maven3 rh
--> cd /opt/maven3/bin                    (change directory to bin to configure the mvn home path)
--> ls
    m2.conf mvn mvn.cmd mvnDebug mvnDebug.cmd mvnyjp
--> vi ~/.bashrc                          ( vi is a editor- using this we are editing the .bashrc file, here ~ is for home path, /.bashrc is the file is
                                            there in the home directory. by passing ~/.bashrc we are calling the home directory .bashrc file)
--> i                                     ( you want to edit press "i" for insert mode)
--> export PATH=/opt/maven3/bin:$PATH     (pass the path under fi --------path of the maven location-- to run the mvn command anywhere in the server)
--> esc + :wq                             ( press esc for exiting from editor mode and :wq for (w) save (q) quit.   --- :q! for exit without saving)
--> after that there are two steps for restarting the server 
    1. by restart the entire ec2-instance
    2. pass the command   " source ~/.bashrc " for restarting the bashrc service---( recommanded)
--> mvn package                           ( by checking the mvn is working or nor  or we can pass mvn --version)
