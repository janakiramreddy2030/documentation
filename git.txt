History of Git
=========================
1. Git is relaesed on 7/04/2005
2. A command-line session showing repository creation, addition of a file, and remote synchronization
3. before git we have used CVS ( concurrent vesion system)
4.You have almost certainly heard Git described as a “distributed” version control system before. ... CVS, short for Concurrent Versions System,
  was the very first second-generation version control system. 
  It was also the most popular version control system for about a decade until it was replaced in 2000 by Subversion.

git stages
=========================

--> working area --> staging area --> local repository --> remote repository


=========================
git workflow
=========================
  develpers will develop their projects locally and they keep up in a safe file   which is call "working area"
					|
					|
					v
  Then we have to add the files to staging area by commanding " git add file-name"
					|
					|
					v
  then we have to commit the files from staging area to local repository with commit message
					|
					|
					v
 then push files from local repository to remote repository
